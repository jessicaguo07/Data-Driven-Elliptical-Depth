# Data-Driven-Elliptical-Depth

Statistical depth, which measures the rank of a given sample with respect to its
underlying distribution in a center-outward manner, has emerged as a powerful tool
in nonparametric inference for multivariate data. Traditional depth functions often
involve a trade-off between desirable theoretical properties and computational
complexity. The spherical depth was proposed to simplify computations while
preserving theoretical merits. The spherical depth function employs circular
influential region without considering the orientation of the data cloud. In the project,
we proposed a data-driven elliptical depth function (DDED) that use ellipses instead
of circles to construct influential regions.
